### Market Gap Identified

**No dominant player specifically addresses**:
1. AI/ML stack cost visibility (GPU + inference + training + LLM APIs)
2. AI-specific unit economics (cost per inference, cost per training run)
3. LLM API cost attribution across multiple providers
4. AI vs. traditional cloud cost separation
5. Proactive AI cost optimization recommendations

## Purchase Triggers

### When do companies buy?

1. **AI budget blowout** — Monthly bill 2-3x higher than expected
2. **Board/CFO pressure** — "What's the ROI on our AI spend?"
3. **Scaling AI initiatives** — Moving from pilot to production
4. **FinOps mandate** — New cost governance initiative launched
5. **Multi-cloud/multi-LLM adoption** — Visibility becomes impossible
6. **GPU capacity crunch** — Need to optimize utilization to avoid hardware purchase

### Budget Cycle Timing

- **Q4**: Annual planning—new tool evaluation begins
- **Q1**: Budget available—procurement kicks off
- **Mid-year reviews**: Cost overrun triggers emergency purchases
