## Key Market Gaps for StackAudit.ai

Based on competitive analysis, these represent significant opportunities:

### 1. **Pricing Transparency**
4 of 5 competitors hide pricing. StackAudit can build trust with clear, published pricing.

### 2. **SMB Accessibility**
No competitor truly serves the SMB market well. Starting prices of $35K+/year exclude smaller companies.

### 3. **Self-Service + Assisted Hybrid**
Most offer either self-service OR concierge—not both. A hybrid model could capture more market.

### 4. **Fast Time-to-Value**
Implementation times of 2+ months are common. StackAudit can differentiate with rapid deployment.

### 5. **Documentation & Onboarding**
Multiple competitors cited for poor documentation. Excellent onboarding is a competitive advantage.

### 6. **Freemium/Free Trial**
Limited free trial options across competitors. A generous free tier could drive adoption.

### 7. **Modern UX**
Several platforms noted for complexity. Clean, intuitive design stands out.
