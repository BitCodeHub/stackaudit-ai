### Body

Hi {{first_name}},

We're thrilled to announce that **StackAudit.ai** is officially live.

**The short version:** Paste any GitHub URL, get a complete analysis of the technology stack, dependencies, and security vulnerabilities in under 60 seconds.

---

### Why We Built This

Every developer has been there:

- Evaluating a new codebase with no documentation
- Inheriting a project and discovering hidden technical debt
- Reviewing a candidate's portfolio with no context
- Auditing dependencies for security issues manually

We built StackAudit because we were tired of flying blind.

---

### What You Get

**Stack Overview**  
Every language, framework, and tool — visualized and quantified.

**Dependency Analysis**  
Complete tree with version health, update status, and risk assessment.

**Security Scanning**  
CVEs detected automatically with severity ratings and fix recommendations.

**AI Insights**  
GPT-4 powered recommendations for improvements, best practices, and optimization.

---

### How It Works

1. **Paste a GitHub URL** — public repos work immediately, connect OAuth for private
2. **Watch the analysis run** — real-time progress as we scan the codebase
3. **Get your report** — comprehensive results in under 60 seconds

That's it. No configuration. No setup. Just answers.

## Email 2: Launch Announcement (Developer Audience)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Ship: Repository X-ray tool
- I open-sourced my "what's in this codebase" workflow
- The tool I wished existed when inheriting projects
- 60-second codebase analysis (no, really)

**Preview Text:** Stack detection, dependency analysis, security scanning. Free tier available.

**From:** Alex from StackAudit <alex@stackaudit.ai>

### Body

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick one — we just shipped something I've wanted forever.

**StackAudit.ai** — paste a GitHub URL, get a complete analysis of the stack in 60 seconds.

**What it does:**
- Detects all languages, frameworks, tools
- Maps the full dependency tree with health status
- Scans for known CVEs
- Generates AI recommendations for improvements

**Why I built it:**

Last year I inherited a project with "some technical debt." Turns out it had 47 outdated dependencies, 3 critical CVEs, and was using 4 different state management libraries.

Would've been nice to know that before I said "sure, I'll take it."

**The pitch:**

Free tier handles public repos with basic analysis. Pro adds private repos, full AI recommendations, PDF exports, and team features.

No signup required to try it — just paste a URL.

**[stackaudit.ai](https://stackaudit.ai)**

Let me know what you think. I read every reply.

— Alex

P.S. If you have a particularly gnarly repo you want to throw at it, I'm curious to see how it handles edge cases. Send it over.

## Email 3: Launch Announcement (Tech Lead / CTO Audience)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "What's the tech stack situation?" — Now you can answer.
- Before your next technical debt conversation

**Preview Text:** AI-powered repository analysis for technical leaders. Full reports in 60 seconds.

---

**From:** The StackAudit Team <hello@stackaudit.ai>

---

### Body

Hi {{first_name}},

We know the conversations you're dreading:

*"What's the security posture of our dependencies?"*  
*"How much technical debt are we carrying?"*  
*"What would it take to upgrade to [framework X]?"*

And the honest answer is often: "I'd need a few weeks to audit that properly."

**Not anymore.**

---

🛡️ **Security Analysis**  
Automated CVE detection with severity ratings, affected versions, and remediation recommendations. Board-ready security posture reports.
